- One directory for each language.
- In each directory there are three files:
    1. *_900.csv  contains the 900 tweets that annotators labelled individually (300 tweets each annotator).
    2. *_tiebreak_100.csv contains the initial 100 tweets all annotators labelled. 'annotator_3' indicates the annotator that was used as a tiebreaker.
    3. *_combined.csv contains the all tweets labelled for the language.
